1 - An addition should work the same as fractions as for integers
2 - The types have to be the same (fractions)
3 - Always express fractions in lowest  terms.
For example (another test!), fraction 4/6 magically becomes 2/3
4 - Always express fractions as improper and not mixed.
For example, I want 7/5, not 1 2/5.
